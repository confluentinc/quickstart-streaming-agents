# Get Help with Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink¶

You can request support in the [Confluent Support Portal](https://support.confluent.io/).

You can access the portal directly, or you can navigate to it from the Confluent Cloud Console by selecting the Support menu identified by the help icon ([](../_images/ccloud-help-icon.png)) in the upper-right and choosing **Support portal**. For more information, see [Confluent Support for Confluent Cloud](../support.html#support-plans-overview).

## Confluent Community Slack¶

There is a dedicated **#flink** channel in the Confluent Community Slack. Join with [this link](https://confluentcommunity.slack.com/archives/C05T5F96UQ7) to ask questions, provide feedback, and engage with other users.

## Troubleshoot Flink in Confluent Cloud Console¶

If issues occur while running Flink in Cloud Console, consider generating a HAR file and uploading it to the [Confluent Community Slack channel](https://confluentcommunity.slack.com/archives/C05T5F96UQ7) or sending it to the [Support Portal](../support.html#request-support).
