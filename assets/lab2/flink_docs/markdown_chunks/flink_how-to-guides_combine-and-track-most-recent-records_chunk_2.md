## Step 2: Create a unified view with most recent recordsÂ¶

Run the following statement to combine multiple streams while tracking the most recent information for each record:

    -- This query combines order and click data, tracking the latest values
    -- for each customer's interactions across both datasets

    -- First, combine order data and clickstream data into a single structure
    -- Note: Fields not present in one source are filled with NULL
    WITH combined_data AS (
      -- Orders data with empty click-related fields
      SELECT
        customer_id,
        order_id,
        product_id,
        price,
        CAST(NULL AS STRING) AS url,        -- Click-specific fields set to NULL
        CAST(NULL AS STRING) AS user_agent, -- for order records
        CAST(NULL AS INT) AS view_time,
        $rowtime
      FROM `examples`.`marketplace`.`orders`
      UNION ALL
      -- Click data with empty order-related fields
      SELECT
        user_id AS customer_id,             -- Normalize user_id to match customer_id
        CAST(NULL AS STRING) AS order_id,   -- Order-specific fields set to NULL
        CAST(NULL AS STRING) AS product_id, -- for click records
        CAST(NULL AS DOUBLE) AS price,
        url,
        user_agent,
        view_time,
        $rowtime
      FROM `examples`.`marketplace`.`clicks`
    )
    -- For each customer, maintain the latest value for each field
    -- using window functions over the combined dataset
    SELECT
      LAST_VALUE(customer_id) OVER w AS customer_id,
      LAST_VALUE(order_id) OVER w AS order_id,
      LAST_VALUE(product_id) OVER w AS product_id,
      LAST_VALUE(price) OVER w AS price,
      LAST_VALUE(url) OVER w AS url,
      LAST_VALUE(user_agent) OVER w AS user_agent,
      LAST_VALUE(view_time) OVER w AS view_time,
      MAX($rowtime) OVER w AS rowtime      -- Track the latest event timestamp
    FROM combined_data
    -- Define window for tracking latest values per customer
    WINDOW w AS (
      PARTITION BY customer_id             -- Group all events by customer
      ORDER BY $rowtime                    -- Order by event timestamp
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING     -- Consider all previous events
        AND CURRENT ROW                    -- up to the current one
    )

Your output should resemble:

    customer_id  order_id                               product_id  price    url                                user_agent                                                                         view_time rowtime

This pattern works by:

  1. Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to combine all streams
  2. Setting fields not present in each stream to NULL
  3. Using window functions to track the most recent data for each field
  4. Partitioning by the common identifier to group related records
  5. Ordering by the [watermark](../../_glossary.html#term-watermark) timestamp (`$rowtime`) to ensure proper temporal sequencing

You can adapt this pattern by:

* Adding more streams to the [UNION ALL](../reference/queries/set-logic.html#flink-sql-set-logic-union)
* Changing the common identifier field in the [PARTITION BY](../reference/queries/match_recognize.html#flink-sql-pattern-recognition-partitioning) clause
* Modifying the selected fields based on your needs
* Using a custom defined watermark strategy
