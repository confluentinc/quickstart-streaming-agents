## How do I move my SQL statements to production?¶

To move your Flink SQL statements to production, follow best practices such as using service accounts, applying least-privilege permissions, and thoroughly testing your statements in a development environment before deploying them to production compute pools. For detailed guidance, see [Best Practices for Moving SQL Statements to Production](operate-and-deploy/best-practices.html#flink-sql-best-practices-for-statements).

You can use GitHub Actions and Terraform to deploy your Flink SQL statements to production. For more information, see [Deploy a Flink SQL Statement Using CI/CD](operate-and-deploy/deploy-flink-sql-statement.html#flink-deploy-sql-statement).

## Where can I get help or support?¶

If you have questions or need support, you can use the in-product help in the Confluent Cloud Console, visit the [Flink documentation](overview.html#ccloud-flink), or reach out through the [established channels](get-help.html#ccloud-flink-help). You can also ask questions in the Confluent Community forums or contact Confluent Support if you have a support plan.
