The following SET options are available only in the Flink SQL shell.

In a Cloud Console workspace, the only `client` option you can set is `client.statement-name`.

Key | Default | Type | Description
---|---|---|---
client.output-format | standard | String | Output format. Valid values are “standard” or “plain-text”.
client.results-timeout | 600000 | Long | Total amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait before timing out the request waiting for results to be ready.
client.service-account | (None) | String | Service account to use instead of running statements attached to your user account. For more information, see [Production workloads (service accounts)](../../operate-and-deploy/flink-rbac.html#flink-rbac-grant-sa-and-user-permission-for-sql-statements).
client.statement-name | (None) | String | Give your Flink statement a meaningful name that can help you identify it more easily. Instead of an autogenerated name, like `123e4567-e89b-12d3`, this sets the statement name to the given value. To avoid naming conflicts, the name resets itself after successful submission. The underscore character (`_`) and period character (`.`) are not supported.
