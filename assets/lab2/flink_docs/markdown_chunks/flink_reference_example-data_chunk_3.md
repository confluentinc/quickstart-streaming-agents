### products tableÂ¶

To access the `products` example stream, use the fully qualified string, `examples.marketplace.products` in your queries.

    CREATE TABLE products (
      product_id INT, -- range between 1000 and 1500
      name STRING, -- set by the datafaker Commerce class
      brand STRING, -- set by the datafaker Commerce class
      vendor STRING, -- set by the datafaker Commerce class
      department STRING, -- set by the datafaker Commerce class
      PRIMARY KEY (product_id) NOT ENFORCED
     );

The product fields are assigned by the [datafaker Commerce class](https://javadoc.io/static/net.datafaker/datafaker/2.1.0/net.datafaker/net/datafaker/providers/base/Commerce.html).

Run the following statement to inspect the `products` data stream:

    SELECT * FROM examples.marketplace.products;

Your output should resemble:

    product_id name                        brand   vendor         department
    1440       Enormous Aluminum Keyboard  LG      Dollar General Garden & Movies
