# Flink Jobs for Confluent Manager for Apache Flink¶

Confluent Manager for Apache Flink® supports two ways to create and manage Flink jobs.

  * [Applications](applications/overview.html#cmf-applications) offer the full flexibility of Flink programs. You can use all JVM-based APIs (DataStream, Table, SQL) and submit and manage applications packaged as JAR files.
  * [Statements](sql-statements/overview.html#flink-sql-statements) offer the ease-of-use of a native SQL interface. You can run interactive SQL statements or submit and manage long-running SQL statements.

Applications and Statements offer all Flink configuration options and can be tuned to meet their performance, fault-tolerance, and security requirements.
