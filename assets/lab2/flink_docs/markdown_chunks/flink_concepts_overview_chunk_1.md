# Stream Processing Concepts in Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink¶

Apache Flink® SQL, a high-level API powered by Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink, offers a simple and easy way to leverage the power of stream processing. With support for a wide variety of built-in [functions](../reference/functions/overview.html#flink-sql-functions-overview), [queries](../reference/queries/overview.html#flink-sql-queries), and [statements](statements.html#flink-sql-statements), Flink SQL provides real-time insights into streaming data. Time is a critical element in stream processing, and Flink SQL makes it easy to process data as it arrives, avoiding delays. By using SQL syntax, you can declare expressions that filter, aggregate, route, and mutate streams of data, simplifying your data processing workflows.
