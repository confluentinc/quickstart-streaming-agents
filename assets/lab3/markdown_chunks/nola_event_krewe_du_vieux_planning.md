# Krewe du Vieux October Planning Party - Marigny

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 7:00 PM - 11:00 PM
**Location:** Marigny Opera House, 725 St. Ferdinand Street
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Annual gathering for Krewe du Vieux members and supporters to finalize parade themes and float designs for the upcoming Mardi Gras season. This invitation-only event brings together New Orleans' most creative and irreverent carnival organization for an evening of planning, socializing, and celebration.

The krewe's reputation for satirical and adult-themed Mardi Gras commentary attracts a diverse mix of artists, writers, musicians, and local personalities. Attendees typically arrive throughout the early evening and often continue festivities at nearby Marigny bars and restaurants after the formal meeting concludes.

Transportation demand peaks during arrival (7:00 PM - 8:00 PM) and departure (10:30 PM - 11:30 PM) periods. Many participants live in other New Orleans districts and utilize riverboat taxi services to reach the Marigny venue, particularly those carrying costume materials and art supplies for the planning session.

The event's location in the heart of the Marigny creates secondary demand as attendees explore the neighborhood's dining and entertainment options before and after the meeting.
