# Warehouse District Happy Hour Crawl

**Frequency:** Daily weekday pattern with Friday peak
**Time:** 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM
**Location:** Warehouse District bars and lounges
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Peak after-work socializing period in Warehouse District arts and entertainment zone. Young professionals and creative industry workers frequent multiple venues during happy hour specials and networking.

Transportation demand builds as workday ends (3:45 PM - 4:30 PM) with professionals from CBD offices and French Quarter businesses. Return demand spreads through evening as happy hour extends to dinner and nightlife activities.
