# French Quarter Art Festival - Jackson Square

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM
**Location:** Jackson Square and surrounding French Quarter streets
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Annual showcase featuring 80+ local and regional artists displaying paintings, sculptures, jewelry, and crafts throughout Jackson Square and adjacent French Quarter streets. The festival transforms the historic district into an open-air gallery, attracting art collectors and cultural enthusiasts from across the Gulf South region.

Artist demonstrations, live music performances, and food vendors create a festive atmosphere that draws steady crowds throughout the day. Many visitors combine the art festival with French Quarter dining and shopping, extending their stay well into the evening hours.

Transportation demand peaks during mid-morning arrival (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM) and late afternoon departure (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM) periods. Many attendees park in other districts and utilize riverboat taxi services to avoid French Quarter traffic congestion, particularly families and older visitors carrying art purchases.

The festival's popularity with suburban residents and tourists staying in Uptown and Garden District hotels creates consistent cross-district transportation needs throughout the event duration.
