# Uptown Outdoor Yoga Festival

**Frequency:** Monthly wellness event
**Time:** 7:00 AM - 9:30 AM
**Location:** Audubon Park, Uptown
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Community wellness event featuring outdoor group yoga, meditation, and healthy living vendors in scenic Audubon Park. Attracts 200-300 wellness enthusiasts from across New Orleans for early morning practice sessions.

Transportation demand peaks before event start (6:45 AM - 7:15 AM) with participants arriving from French Quarter, Marigny, and CBD areas. Post-event departure (9:15 AM - 9:45 AM) creates secondary demand as attendees head to brunch locations or return home.
