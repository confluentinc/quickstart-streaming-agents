# Tipitina's Live Music Night

**Frequency:** Multiple weekly shows
**Time:** 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM
**Location:** Tipitina's, Uptown
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Legendary music venue hosting local and touring acts performing funk, rock, and New Orleans music. Shows attract 400-600 music fans to iconic Uptown venue with deep musical heritage.

Transportation demand peaks before show start (7:30 PM - 8:15 PM) with music fans from French Quarter, Marigny, and downtown areas. Return demand builds after shows (11:00 PM - 11:30 PM) as concertgoers head to late-night venues or hotels.
