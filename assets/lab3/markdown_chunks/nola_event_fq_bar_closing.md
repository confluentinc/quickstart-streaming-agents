# French Quarter Bar Closing Rush

**Frequency:** Nightly closing pattern
**Time:** 11:00 PM - 2:00 AM
**Location:** French Quarter bars (widespread)
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Mass departure period as numerous French Quarter bars reach closing time. Creates concentrated transportation demand as 1,500-2,500 bar patrons simultaneously seek rides to hotels and other destinations.

Transportation demand surges dramatically during closing hours (1:45 AM - 2:30 AM) with patrons heading to Uptown, Garden District, CBD hotels, and late-night food venues. Represents peak late-night riverboat taxi demand period.
