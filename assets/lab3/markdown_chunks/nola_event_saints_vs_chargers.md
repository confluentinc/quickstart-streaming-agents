# New Orleans Saints Home Game - Superdome

**Time:** 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM
**Location:** Caesars Superdome, Central Business District
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

NFL game featuring the New Orleans Saints at the Superdome. The venue accommodates 73,000+ passionate Saints fans for afternoon games, creating massive transportation demand throughout the Central Business District and French Quarter areas.

Pre-game festivities begin mid-morning with tailgating in surrounding lots and Champion Square activities. The game attracts fans from throughout Louisiana and the Gulf South region.

Transportation demand peaks during pre-game arrivals (12:00 PM - 2:30 PM) and post-game departures (6:30 PM - 8:00 PM). The afternoon timing draws families and creates sustained demand for riverboat taxi services from hotels, parking areas, and entertainment districts.

Many out-of-town fans extend their visit into the evening, seeking transportation to French Quarter restaurants and bars for post-game celebrations, creating secondary demand waves throughout the downtown area.
