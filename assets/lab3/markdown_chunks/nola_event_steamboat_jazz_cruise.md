# Steamboat Afternoon Jazz Cruise

**Frequency:** Daily departures
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM

**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Afternoon riverboat cruise featuring live jazz band and Mississippi River narration aboard paddlewheeler. Popular tourist attraction accommodating 250-350 passengers for classic New Orleans experience.

Transportation demand concentrates before boarding (1:30 PM - 2:00 PM) with tourists from CBD, Warehouse District, and Uptown hotels. Creates synergy with riverboat taxi services as water-based transportation aligns with cruise experience theme.
