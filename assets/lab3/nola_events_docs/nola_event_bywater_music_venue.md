# Bywater Music Venue Concert

**Frequency:** Multiple weekly shows
**Time:** 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM
**Location:** Various Bywater music venues
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Local and touring indie bands performing at Bywater neighborhood venues. Shows attract 200-400 music fans to neighborhood's eclectic music scene featuring alternative, indie rock, and experimental music.

Transportation demand before show start (7:30 PM - 8:15 PM) with music fans from French Quarter and downtown areas. Bywater location creates demand for riverboat service as convenient access to neighborhood's growing entertainment district.
