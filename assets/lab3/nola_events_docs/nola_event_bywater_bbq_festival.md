# Bywater Fall BBQ Festival - Crescent Park

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 11:00 AM - 6:00 PM
**Location:** Crescent Park, Bywater
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Community celebration featuring 15 local BBQ vendors, live blues music, and family activities along the Mississippi River in scenic Crescent Park. The festival showcases authentic New Orleans-style barbecue alongside traditional sides and local craft beverages.

This neighborhood event attracts food enthusiasts from across the metro area seeking authentic BBQ culture outside the typical tourist zones. The festival's riverside location and limited parking create transportation challenges that many attendees solve by utilizing riverboat taxi services from other districts.

Transportation demand peaks during lunch hours (12:00 PM - 2:00 PM) and early evening departure (5:00 PM - 6:30 PM) as visitors seek convenient access to the somewhat isolated Bywater location. The festival's popularity with families carrying picnic supplies and elderly visitors creates preference for door-to-door transportation options.

Many attendees combine the BBQ festival with exploration of Bywater's art galleries and unique shops, extending their neighborhood presence beyond the official event hours.
