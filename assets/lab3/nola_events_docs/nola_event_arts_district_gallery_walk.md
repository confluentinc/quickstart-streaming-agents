# Arts District Gallery Walk - Warehouse District

**Frequency:** Recurring monthly event
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM
**Location:** Multiple galleries throughout Arts District, Warehouse District
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Monthly coordinated event featuring 18 galleries and artist studios opening simultaneously throughout the Warehouse District's arts corridor. Featured exhibitions include contemporary paintings, sculptures, photography, and mixed media from local and regional artists.

The gallery walk encourages art enthusiasts to move between venues throughout the evening, creating steady pedestrian traffic and transportation demand along Julia Street, Camp Street, and surrounding arts district blocks. Many participants begin with early evening receptions before transitioning between galleries.

Transportation demand peaks during arrival (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM) and departure (9:30 PM - 10:30 PM) periods as visitors seek convenient access to multiple gallery locations. The event attracts art collectors from Uptown, Garden District, and French Quarter who utilize riverboat taxi services for comfortable evening transportation.

Many gallery walk participants combine the event with dinner at nearby Warehouse District restaurants, extending their presence in the area beyond the official gallery hours and creating sustained local demand.
