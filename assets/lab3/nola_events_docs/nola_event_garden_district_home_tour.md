# Garden District Historic Home Tour

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM
**Location:** Multiple historic mansions throughout Garden District
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Annual self-guided tour featuring 8 carefully selected historic mansions and gardens in New Orleans' most architecturally significant neighborhood. The tour showcases 19th-century antebellum architecture, period furnishings, and meticulously maintained gardens with expert docents providing historical context.

This upscale cultural event attracts architecture enthusiasts, interior design professionals, and affluent tourists seeking authentic New Orleans heritage experiences. Tour participants typically spend 45-60 minutes at each location, moving throughout the neighborhood during the day.

Transportation demand occurs in waves as visitors move between tour stops, with peak periods during mid-morning arrivals (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM) and afternoon transitions (1:00 PM - 3:00 PM). The Garden District's narrow streets and limited parking create preference for guided transportation services, particularly among elderly visitors and groups.

Many tour participants combine the home tour with lunch at nearby Commander's Palace or other Garden District establishments, extending their neighborhood presence and creating additional transportation needs throughout the day.
