# Magazine Street Fall Festival - Uptown

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM
**Location:** Magazine Street from Napoleon to Jefferson Avenue
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Annual street festival transforming 6 blocks of Magazine Street into a pedestrian mall featuring 100+ vendors, local artisans, food trucks, and live entertainment. The festival showcases Uptown's vibrant shopping district while celebrating local crafts, cuisine, and culture.

This popular event attracts families and shoppers from throughout the New Orleans metro area, creating significant congestion along Magazine Street and surrounding Uptown neighborhoods. The festival's length and vendor variety encourage extended visits, with many attendees spending 4-6 hours exploring the offerings.

Transportation demand peaks during mid-morning arrivals (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM) and late afternoon departures (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM). Limited Uptown parking forces many visitors to utilize riverboat taxi services from other districts, particularly families with children and elderly visitors carrying purchases.

The festival's popularity with suburban residents creates substantial cross-district transportation needs, with many attendees combining the event with Magazine Street shopping and Uptown restaurant dining.
