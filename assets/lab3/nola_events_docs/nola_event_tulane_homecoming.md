# Tulane University Homecoming Weekend - Uptown

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** Various events 10:00 AM - 10:00 PM
**Location:** Tulane University Campus, Uptown
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Annual homecoming celebration featuring alumni gatherings, campus tours, student performances, and evening receptions throughout the Tulane University campus. The weekend brings together current students, alumni, faculty, and families for a comprehensive university celebration.

Homecoming events attract visitors from across the country, many unfamiliar with New Orleans transportation options. The celebration includes multiple simultaneous activities across campus, creating movement between venues and sustained demand throughout the day.

Transportation demand peaks during morning arrivals for campus activities (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM), afternoon transitions between events (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM), and evening reception arrivals (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM). Many out-of-town alumni staying in French Quarter and Warehouse District hotels utilize riverboat taxi services for scenic campus access.

The university's proximity to Magazine Street creates additional demand as visitors combine homecoming activities with Uptown shopping and dining, extending their presence in the area beyond official event schedules.
