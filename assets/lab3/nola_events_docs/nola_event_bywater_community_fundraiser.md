# Bywater Community Center Fundraiser

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 10:00 PM
**Location:** Bywater Community Center, 3314 Dauphine Street
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Annual fundraising dinner and silent auction supporting the Bywater Neighborhood Association's community programs and facility maintenance. Local restaurants donate cuisine while residents and supporters bid on artwork, services, and experiences contributed by neighborhood businesses.

This grassroots event primarily serves Bywater residents and nearby neighbors, though it attracts some supporters from other New Orleans districts who value community development initiatives. The intimate setting accommodates approximately 150 attendees in a casual, family-friendly atmosphere.

Transportation demand remains light with gradual arrival between 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM and steady departure around 9:30 PM - 10:30 PM. Most attendees live within walking or biking distance, though some supporters from Uptown, Garden District, and French Quarter utilize riverboat taxi services to reach the Bywater location.

The event's emphasis on community building and local support creates a warm neighborhood gathering that occasionally extends to nearby Bywater bars and restaurants as the evening concludes.
