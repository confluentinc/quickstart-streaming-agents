# WWOZ Piano Night Fundraiser - Multiple Venues

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 7:00 PM - 1:00 AM
**Location:** 15+ venues throughout French Quarter and Marigny
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Annual fundraising event for WWOZ radio featuring New Orleans' finest piano players performing simultaneously at venues throughout the French Quarter and Marigny. Participants purchase wristbands allowing access to all participating venues for a night of exceptional piano music.

This beloved local tradition attracts serious jazz and blues enthusiasts seeking authentic New Orleans musical experiences on Halloween night. The multi-venue format encourages venue-hopping throughout the evening, creating sustained foot traffic and transportation demand.

Transportation demand remains steady throughout the evening as music lovers move between venues including Preservation Hall, d.b.a., The Spotted Cat, and Napoleon House. Peak periods occur during initial venue arrivals (7:00 PM - 8:00 PM) and late-night transitions (11:00 PM - 1:00 AM).

The Halloween timing creates additional demand as many participants combine piano night with French Quarter Halloween festivities, extending their evening entertainment and creating overlapping transportation needs throughout the historic districts.
