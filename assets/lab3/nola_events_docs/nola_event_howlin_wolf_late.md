# Howlin' Wolf Late Show

**Frequency:** Multiple weekly late shows
**Time:** 10:30 PM - 1:30 AM
**Location:** Howlin' Wolf, Warehouse District
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Late-night live music shows featuring rock, indie, and alternative bands. Venue accommodates 300-500 music fans for after-hours concerts in Warehouse District entertainment zone.

Transportation demand before late show (10:15 PM - 10:45 PM) with music fans from French Quarter and CBD areas. Post-show departure (1:30 AM - 2:00 AM) creates late-night return demand as concertgoers seek transportation home.
