# Broadway South Theatre Performance

**Frequency:** Weekly show schedule
**Time:** 7:30 PM - 10:00 PM
**Location:** Saenger Theatre and Joy Theater, CBD
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Touring Broadway productions and theatrical performances at downtown venues. Shows attract 800-1,400 theatre patrons dressed for evening entertainment seeking cultural experiences.

Transportation demand concentrates during arrival (7:00 PM - 7:30 PM) with well-dressed theatregoers from Garden District, French Quarter, and Uptown. Post-show departure (10:00 PM - 10:30 PM) creates demand for return trips and restaurant transportation.
