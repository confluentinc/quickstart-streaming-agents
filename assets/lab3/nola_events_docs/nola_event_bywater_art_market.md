**Location:** St. Claude Avenue between Louisa and Franklin Streets
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Monthly showcase of 40+ local artists, craftspeople, and makers displaying original artwork, handmade goods, and unique creations in the heart of the Bywater arts district. The market emphasizes affordable original art and supports emerging artists in New Orleans' most creative neighborhood.

This grassroots event attracts art collectors, young professionals, and tourists seeking authentic local culture away from mainstream venues. The market's focus on emerging artists and affordable pieces draws a diverse crowd including art students, local residents, and culturally curious visitors.

Transportation demand remains moderate with steady arrival patterns throughout the morning (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM) and gradual departure during afternoon hours (3:00 PM - 4:30 PM).
