# French Quarter Nightlife Peak Hours

**Frequency:** Nightly entertainment district
**Time:** 9:00 PM - 12:00 AM
**Location:** French Quarter bars, clubs, restaurants
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Peak nightlife period with French Quarter's entertainment venues operating at maximum capacity. Attracts 3,000-4,000 revelers nightly to bars, live music venues, and late-night restaurants creating vibrant street atmosphere.

Transportation demand sustained throughout evening (9:00 PM - 11:00 PM) with party-goers arriving from hotels across city. French Quarter's reputation as entertainment destination drives continuous riverboat taxi demand during peak nightlife hours.
