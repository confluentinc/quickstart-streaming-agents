# National Comedy Tour - Orpheum Theater

**Frequency:** Recurring touring event
**Time:** 8:00 PM - 10:30 PM
**Location:** Orpheum Theater, 129 Roosevelt Way, CBD
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Touring comedy show featuring nationally recognized comedians including headliner Gabriel Iglesias with opening acts performing for 1,400+ audience members in the historic Orpheum Theater. The family-friendly show attracts diverse audiences seeking quality entertainment.

This Friday evening event draws comedy fans from throughout the New Orleans metropolitan area and surrounding parishes. The downtown location provides convenient access while the historic theater setting creates preference for reliable transportation options among well-dressed attendees.

Transportation demand peaks during arrival (7:30 PM - 8:00 PM) and departure (10:30 PM - 11:30 PM) periods as audience members seek convenient access to the CBD venue. Many attendees combine the show with pre-theater dining or post-show French Quarter entertainment.

The Friday night timing creates sustained demand as comedy show attendees often continue their evening with French Quarter nightlife, generating additional transportation needs throughout the downtown entertainment corridor.
