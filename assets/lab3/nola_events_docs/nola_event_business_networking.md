# New Orleans Chamber Fall Networking Mixer - CBD

**Frequency:** Recurring monthly event
**Time:** 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM
**Location:** Hilton New Orleans Riverside, 2 Poydras Street
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Monthly business networking event bringing together 300+ chamber members, entrepreneurs, and business professionals for an evening of connections and collaboration. The mixer features local business showcases, professional development discussions, and informal networking opportunities.

This professional gathering attracts business leaders from diverse industries including finance, real estate, hospitality, and technology sectors. The Central Business District location provides convenient access for downtown professionals while drawing participants from throughout the metro area.

Transportation demand peaks during arrival (5:30 PM - 6:30 PM) and departure (7:30 PM - 8:30 PM) periods as business professionals transition from work activities to evening networking and back to residences across various districts. Many attendees continue networking at nearby CBD restaurants and bars after the formal event.

The professional nature of the event creates preference for reliable, punctual transportation services that allow business card exchanges and continued conversations during transit to follow-up venues.
