# Children's Hospital Foundation Gala - Garden District

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 6:30 PM - 11:00 PM
**Location:** Commander's Palace Private Dining Rooms
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Exclusive fundraising gala supporting Children's Hospital of New Orleans, featuring gourmet dining, silent auction, and entertainment in the elegant setting of Commander's Palace's historic private dining spaces. The invitation-only event accommodates 200 prominent community leaders and philanthropists.

This high-end charitable event attracts New Orleans' social elite, medical professionals, and business leaders committed to children's healthcare initiatives. The formal dress code and upscale venue create expectations for premium transportation services among attendees.

Transportation demand concentrates during arrival (6:30 PM - 7:30 PM) and departure (10:30 PM - 11:30 PM) periods as formally dressed guests seek elegant transportation options. The Garden District location and exclusive nature of the event create strong preference for private transportation services.

Many gala attendees reside in other New Orleans districts and utilize riverboat taxi services for sophisticated transportation that complements the evening's elegant atmosphere while avoiding concerns about parking and security in formal attire.
