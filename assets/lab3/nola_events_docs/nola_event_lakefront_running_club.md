# Lakefront Running Club Weekend Meetup

**Frequency:** Weekly Saturday and Sunday
**Time:** 6:30 AM - 8:00 AM
**Location:** Lake Pontchartrain, City Park area
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Organized running group meeting for training runs along scenic lakefront paths. Group of 50-100 regular participants from various neighborhoods converge for group runs ranging from 5K to half-marathon distances.

Light transportation demand concentrated at start time (6:15 AM - 6:45 AM) as runners arrive from French Quarter, Marigny, and downtown areas. Minimal return demand as most participants drive or use alternative transport after runs.
