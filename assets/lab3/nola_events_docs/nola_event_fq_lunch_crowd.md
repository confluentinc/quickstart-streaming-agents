# French Quarter Lunch Service Peak

**Frequency:** Daily lunch pattern
**Time:** 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM
**Location:** Multiple French Quarter restaurants
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Peak lunch period across French Quarter's numerous restaurants serving tourists and business diners. Attracts 1,500-2,500 diners to establishments ranging from casual cafes to upscale Creole restaurants.

Transportation demand surges at lunch start (11:30 AM - 12:30 PM) with diners from CBD offices, Warehouse District, and surrounding hotels. French Quarter's concentration of dining options creates sustained riverboat taxi demand throughout lunch hours.
