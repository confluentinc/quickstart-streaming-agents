# City Park Sculpture Garden Event

**Frequency:** Monthly arts program
**Time:** 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM
**Location:** Sydney and Walda Besthoff Sculpture Garden, City Park
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Morning art appreciation program featuring guided tours of outdoor sculpture collection. Small groups of 30-50 art enthusiasts and students explore world-class sculptures in scenic garden setting.

Minimal transportation demand with arrival (8:45 AM - 9:15 AM) primarily consisting of local art patrons and students. Limited impact on riverboat demand due to City Park location and predominantly local, car-owning attendees.
