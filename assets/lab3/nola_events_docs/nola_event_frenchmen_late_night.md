# Frenchmen Street Late Night Music Scene

**Frequency:** Nightly entertainment district
**Time:** 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM
**Location:** Frenchmen Street, Marigny
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Peak late-night entertainment period on Frenchmen Street with multiple live music venues operating simultaneously. Attracts 800-1,200 music fans nightly to authentic New Orleans music scene featuring jazz, funk, and brass bands.

Transportation demand builds throughout late evening (9:45 PM - 11:00 PM) with music fans from French Quarter hotels and CBD areas. Return demand peaks at closing time (2:00 AM - 2:30 AM) as venues close and patrons seek transportation home.
