# Audubon Park Fall Concert Series - Uptown

**Frequency:** Recurring seasonal event
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM
**Location:** Audubon Park Pavilion, St. Charles Avenue
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Free outdoor concert featuring the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra performing classical favorites and contemporary pieces in the scenic Audubon Park setting. This family-friendly cultural event serves the Uptown community while attracting classical music enthusiasts from across New Orleans.

The concert draws a diverse audience including Tulane and Loyola university communities, Uptown families, and visitors seeking high-quality cultural programming in a beautiful outdoor setting. Many attendees arrive early with picnics and blankets for pre-concert relaxation in the park.

Transportation demand shows steady patterns during arrival (5:30 PM - 6:30 PM) and departure (8:00 PM - 8:30 PM) periods. The park's location near the St. Charles streetcar line provides some public transit access, though many visitors from other districts utilize riverboat taxi services for convenient direct transport.

The concert's appeal to older demographics and families with young children creates preference for door-to-door transportation options, particularly given the challenge of carrying picnic supplies and concert chairs.
