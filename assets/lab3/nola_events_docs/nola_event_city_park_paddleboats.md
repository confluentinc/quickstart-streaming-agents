# City Park Paddleboat Peak Hours

**Frequency:** Daily during warm months
**Time:** 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
**Location:** City Park, Storyland area
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Peak afternoon paddleboat rental period at City Park's scenic lagoons. Families and couples rent paddleboats for leisurely afternoon recreation in beautiful park setting.

Minimal transportation demand impact due to City Park location and predominantly local, car-owning visitors. Some tourist families from downtown hotels utilize riverboat service as part of broader City Park day trip.
