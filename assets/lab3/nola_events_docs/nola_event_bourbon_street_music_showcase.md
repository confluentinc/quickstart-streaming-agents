# Bourbon Street Music Showcase - Multiple Venues

**Frequency:** Recurring event
**Time:** 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM
**Location:** Multiple venues along Bourbon Street, French Quarter
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Coordinated live music event featuring simultaneous performances at 12 different Bourbon Street venues, including Maison Bourbon, The Famous Door, and Cats Meow. Local jazz, blues, and funk bands perform throughout the evening, creating a unified musical experience along the historic entertainment corridor.

The showcase encourages venue-hopping as attendees move between clubs to experience different musical styles and artists. This creates continuous foot traffic and transportation demand as groups navigate between venues and from other districts to join the festivities.

Many participants begin the evening with dinner in the French Quarter before transitioning to the music venues, extending the duration of area demand. Late-night conclusion generates concentrated departure demand between midnight and 2:00 AM as visitors seek transportation back to hotels throughout the city.

The event attracts music enthusiasts from neighboring parishes and tourists staying in various New Orleans districts, creating diverse transportation needs throughout the French Quarter area.
