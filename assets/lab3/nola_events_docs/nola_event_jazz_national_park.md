# Jazz National Historical Park Performance

**Frequency:** Weekly afternoon concerts
**Time:** 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM
**Location:** New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park, French Quarter
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

Free afternoon jazz performances showcasing New Orleans musical heritage. Intimate concerts in historic setting attract 80-120 jazz enthusiasts, music students, and tourists interested in authentic traditional jazz.

Light transportation demand before performance (2:45 PM - 3:15 PM) with mix of tourists and local jazz fans. Convenient French Quarter location creates minimal demand impact but attracts culturally-engaged travelers using riverboat services.
