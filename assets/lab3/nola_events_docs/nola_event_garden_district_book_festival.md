Annual celebration of literature featuring 25+ authors, poets, and literary figures conducting readings, book signings, and discussions throughout Lafayette Square and historic Garden District locations. The festival emphasizes Southern literature, New Orleans authors, and contemporary fiction.

This intellectual cultural event attracts book enthusiasts, university faculty, and literary tourists from across the region. The festival's multiple venues encourage movement throughout the Garden District as attendees follow favorite authors to different speaking locations and book signing sessions.

Transportation demand peaks during late morning arrivals (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM) and evening departures (4:30 PM - 6:00 PM) as literary enthusiasts seek convenient access to multiple venue locations.
