# French Quarter Midnight Bar Scene

**Frequency:** Nightly late hours
**Time:** 11:00 PM - 2:00 AM
**Location:** French Quarter late-night bars
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Late-night bar period with French Quarter venues serving crowds until closing time. Attracts 2,000-3,000 late-night revelers to bars remaining open past midnight for continued entertainment and socializing.

Transportation demand throughout late evening (11:00 PM - 1:00 AM) with continued arrivals from hotels and other districts. Major return demand surge at bar closing (2:00 AM - 2:30 AM) as French Quarter empties creating peak late-night riverboat taxi demand.
