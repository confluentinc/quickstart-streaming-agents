# Riverfront Food Truck Rally

**Frequency:** Weekly Friday event
**Time:** 11:30 AM - 2:30 PM
**Location:** Riverfront, Woldenberg Park

Popular Friday food truck gathering featuring 15-20 vendors serving diverse cuisines. Attracts 500-700 office workers, tourists, and locals to riverfront park for casual outdoor dining experience.
