# Audubon Zoo Twilight Hours

**Frequency:** Seasonal evening hours program
**Time:** 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM
**Location:** Audubon Zoo, Uptown
**Expected Demand Impact:** MEDIUM

Extended evening zoo hours during warm months featuring cooler animal viewing conditions. Attracts families and tourists seeking late afternoon wildlife experience with special twilight programming.

Transportation demand increases during late afternoon (3:45 PM - 4:30 PM) with families from French Quarter hotels and CBD areas. Return demand builds as zoo closing approaches (6:45 PM - 7:15 PM) creating evening riverboat ridership.
