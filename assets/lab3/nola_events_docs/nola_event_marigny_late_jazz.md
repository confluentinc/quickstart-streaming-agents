# Marigny Late Night Jazz Sessions

**Frequency:** Weekly late night sessions
**Time:** 11:00 PM - 2:00 AM
**Location:** Marigny jazz clubs
**Expected Demand Impact:** LOW

After-hours jazz sessions featuring local musicians in intimate Marigny venues. Late-night performances attract 100-200 serious jazz enthusiasts and musicians for improvisational sets in neighborhood clubs.

Light transportation demand before sessions (10:45 PM - 11:15 PM) with jazz fans from French Quarter and downtown. Marigny's proximity to French Quarter makes riverboat taxi convenient for late-night music exploration.
