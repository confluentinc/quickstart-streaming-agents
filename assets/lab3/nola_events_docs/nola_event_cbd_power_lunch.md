# CBD Power Lunch Series

**Frequency:** Daily weekday pattern
**Time:** 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM
**Location:** Multiple CBD restaurants
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Peak business lunch period in Central Business District with professionals dining at upscale restaurants. Creates concentrated demand across CBD dining establishments serving business clientele.

Transportation demand spikes at lunch start (11:45 AM - 12:15 PM) and return to offices (1:30 PM - 2:00 PM). Business professionals from riverfront offices and French Quarter utilize riverboat service for efficient restaurant access and client meetings.
