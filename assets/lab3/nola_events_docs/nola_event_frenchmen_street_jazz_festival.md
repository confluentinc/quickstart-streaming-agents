# Frenchmen Street Fall Jazz Festival - Marigny

**Frequency:** Recurring annual event
**Time:** 7:00 PM - 1:00 AM
**Location:** Multiple venues along Frenchmen Street, Marigny
**Expected Demand Impact:** HIGH

Annual celebration featuring simultaneous jazz performances at Spotted Cat Music Club, d.b.a., The Maison, and Blue Nile. Local jazz legends and emerging artists perform throughout the evening, creating New Orleans' most authentic live music experience outside the French Quarter.

The festival draws music purists and locals seeking genuine jazz culture away from tourist-heavy Bourbon Street. Continuous performances encourage audience migration between venues, generating sustained foot traffic and transportation demand throughout the Marigny district.

Many attendees arrive from other districts via riverboat taxi to avoid parking challenges in the narrow Marigny streets. The festival's late-night schedule creates significant departure demand between midnight and 1:30 AM as visitors seek transportation back to hotels and residences citywide.

The event's reputation for showcasing authentic New Orleans jazz attracts music enthusiasts from across the region, many of whom extend their visit with dinner in the Marigny before transitioning to the music venues.
